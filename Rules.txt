Question: {Strategic icon scale not applied to subsequent games
c696d43311f70140f81a5911c3cc92bc59389d0e by @Garanas added the ability to scale strategic icons â€“ a godsend for large displays. However, the setting is only applied for the current game; subsequent games launch with default scale (despite the setting being persisted and shown correctly in the dialog).

When launching a new game, the scale setting should be applied again.
If I read FAForever/FA-Binary-Patches#45(40b07a2) correctly, it provides the function ui_StrategicIconScale but does not apply it.

Also: Thanks to all devs and a happy 2024!}
